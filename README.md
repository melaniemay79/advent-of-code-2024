# Advent of Code 2024

These are my solutions for the [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024).

So far, all of my solutions are in PHP. I'm using PHP 8.13.14 and running my code locally with [Tinkerwell](https://tinkerwell.app/). I am also using [PHPStan](https://phpstan.org/) @level 9 to check for errors in my code.
