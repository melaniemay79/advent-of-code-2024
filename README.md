# Advent of Code 2024

These are my solutions for the [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024).

My solutions are MVC-based PHP. I'm using a controller in [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) to call the classes. I'm using level 9 [PHPStan](https://phpstan.org/) to check for errors.

You can view the output of the solutions [on my personal website](https://www.punktress.com/advent-of-code/2024).
